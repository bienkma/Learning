"""
Write code that can compute the surface of circle, using the variables radius
and pi = 3.14159. The formula, in case you do not know, is radius times radius times pi.
Print the outcome of your program as follows: â€œThe surface area of a circle with radius ...
is ...
"""
pi = 3.14159
radius = 3

surface = pi * (radius**2)

print("Surface: %s" % (surface))
